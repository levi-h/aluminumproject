This page walks you through using Aluminum for the first time. The guide is separated into three parts. Please refer to the part that matches your scenario.

## Downloading Aluminum ##

Regardless of how you're planning to use Aluminum, you'll have to download it first. You can find a stable release at [the downloads section](http://code.google.com/p/aluminumproject/downloads/list), but you can [build a distribution archive by hand](BuildFromSource.md) as well.

## Deciding how to use Aluminum ##

Aluminum can be used in a number of ways:

  * [Standalone](GettingStartedStandalone.md);
  * From the [command line](GettingStartedCommandLine.md);
  * In a [servlet environment](GettingStartedServletEnvironment.md).
