There are a lot of ways in which you can contribute:
  * By trying Aluminum: download the library and give it a spin;
  * By giving feedback: share your experiences, create or comment on issues, provide ideas for new features;
  * By spreading the word: get others to try Aluminum as well;
  * By providing code or documentation: send patches or let us know about your fork.

There are probably more ways to help; any effort that you make to improve Aluminum is very much appreciated!
